# Enable or Disable Debug messages
# for example :
# 	DEBUG_MODE = y or
# 	DEBUG_MODE = n
DEBUG_MODE = n

# To show the result of initialization
# for example :
#	SHOW_INITIAL = y or
# 	SHOW_INITIAL = n
SHOW_INITIAL = n

# You can add trace messages into you code.
# It'll help you to understand the call flow of the program.
# for example :
# 	TRACE_CODE = y or
# 	TRACE_CODE = n
TRACE_CODE = n
